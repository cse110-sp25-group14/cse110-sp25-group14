## Team Values
    - [ ] No micromanaging, but a respect for everyone else on the team and responsibility for our share of the work 
    - [ ] Get things done early, ideally one day before
    - [ ] Read things immediately 
    - [ ] React to messages on slack to show that they've been read 
    - [ ] Meetings: 
            - Work meetings are better in person, updates can be online 
            - Meet once a week for now, consider increasing once workload increases 
    - [ ] People with web dev/internship experience will help explain things once coding begins 
    - [ ] It's good to ask questions! There are no bad questions.
