CSE 110 4/25 Meeting (6–7 PM)

Attendance:
Carl Casares, Aarush Mehortra, Emily Cai, Mark Escarilla, Travis Huang, Victoria Tran, Gautam Mohandas, Nilay Bhoot

Goals:
Continue brainstorming
Work on pitch
Discuss design and ideas 

TODOs:
Start wireframes individually, then come together to create a semi-final wireframe
Work on system diagram together after designs/wireframes are finalized

Meeting Notes:
Focus on developing the main idea first
If time permits, prioritize quality, testing, and potentially add a "study" mode
Users can add terms and definitions to study, similar to Quizlet matching, but with a unique card-flipping twist
Finish pitch by Sunday

Games to Implement:
Memory/matching game
Sequence memory game
Study game (matching mode, if time allows)

Theme/Mood Decisions:
Initially lean toward brighter color schemes
Allow dark/light mode switching (to cater to younger audiences)
Focus on lighter colors first
Creative freedom with card designs:
	Pokémon theme
	CSE-themed / Powell Library-themed
	Animals
	Sports (e.g., soccer players, NBA team logos)
Consider implementing daily challenges

User Persona Considerations:
Easy navigation for both older and younger users
Interface should be minimal, but engaging and fun
Strive for a good balance between simplicity and visual appeal
People our age are probably going to play other games, so our audience would be both extremes: younger and older people

Additional Ideas:
Login for leaderboard tracking
Leaderboard!! YESSS!!!
Focus on tracking time for stats (for now)
Maybe incorporate the amount of moves

Starting Pitch:
Risks & Rabbit Holes:
	Avoiding concurrency
	Aesthetic message board?
	Worries about a huge front-end effort
Visual diagrams
Statement of purpose
User personas
